					<tr>
						<th class="question">What materials are your products made of?</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th class="answer">Our products are made with natural materials: marble, slate, terracotta. Our
							area is worldwide know for its millennial tradition in quarrying and working beautiful
							natural stones.</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th class="question">Do your products need a special maintenance? How do you clean them?</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th class="answer">No, our products can be used for interior decoration, colors can fade in
							direct sunlight. The best method for cleaning is with a damp soft sponge or cloth. Our
							tiles, coasters and plates have to be washed using water and soap, no other chemical
							product. Please do not use any abrasive cleaners or pads, this will scratch the image. Do
							not put in dishwasher.</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th class="question">Do your coasters and trivets absorb moisture?</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th class="answer">No, our proprietary production process encourages liquids to bead-up on the
							surface.</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th class="question">How is the image printed on the surface?</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th class="answer">The image is printed onto the surface of the stone/terracotta using a
							combination of our proprietary inks and finishing process. Because they are naturally
							slightly porous, the image is “grabbed” or absorbed by the surface of the stone so it does
							not peel or flake.</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th class="question">How do the products come packaged?</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th class="answer">They do not have any special packaging, they come bulk shipped. Our case
							boxes are specifically designed to prevent damage and protect the merchandise. Over the
							years our experience is that packaging gets in the way of showing the images and the look
							and feed of fine marble giftware. We manufacture a “look and feel” product, it is hard to
							differentiate the beauty and heft if your customers can’t feel the product. We anyway offer
							packaging options at an additional cost for both single pieces and sets of produtcs. Please
							ask your Sales resource for further details.</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th class="question">Can the tiles be used for a backsplash?</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th class="answer">Our tiles make beautiful backsplashes. Simply order with no backs, mount to
							the wall with a construction adhesive, grout with non-sanded grout and seal. We also sell
							the field tile to complete your project and maintain the same beautiful old looking
							finishes.</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th class="question">What are your best sellers?</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th class="answer">We get asked this all the time and I know it is very frustrating when we
							say…well it depends on your location and on the type of business you run! The great news is
							that between our extensive line you will for sure find the best for you, and with your
							imagination we can create your own bestseller!</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th class="question">Do you have any (fill-in the blank) images?</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th class="answer">Having produced images for over 20 years we have seen some pretty crazy, some
							very clever, and some really lovely designs. Since most sets are comprised of four unique
							images we have thousands of little pieces of artwork to select from. Our licensed artists
							help us round out the collections with their unique looks and perspectives. We like to think
							that we have images that could fit any theme…and if we don’t now, we can create them. Please
							just add a comment to your order if you are looking for something you can’t find and let us
							do the search work for you.</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th class="question">Do you offer custom and what are the minimums?</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th class="answer">Yes we offer custom printing – it’s quick and easy . Once the sample is made
							and approved each additional custom set is priced the same as our stock sets. Custom images
							can be used across the product line so we will scale your artwork for tiles, trivets,
							coasters, hooks, clocks, magnets, wine stoppers, ornaments... Once your custom image is
							approved and coded by us the lead time for your custom order is no different than if you
							ordered from our Collections. Please do not send original artwork since we can’t take
							responsibility for it to be safely returned to you. Also please bear in mind and respect all
							copyright and trademark restrictions.</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th class="question">What if my product arrives damaged?</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th class="answer">We are always regretful if for any reason something is unsatisfactory. It is
							important that you are able to educate your customer that our " antique look" and the
							product itself is tumbled, so the rustic edges and pitting is not a defect. The tumbling
							process is an added expense to our product but we love the authentic rock look and feel it
							gives our products.</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th class="question">Broken tiles</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th class="answer">Due to the nature of the rock there can be fissions that the human eye cannot
							see that will open up - cracking a tile during shipment due to the movement of transit. If
							something is broken in shipment we are more than happy to replace it for you. Just give us a
							call or send us a note here on the website referencing the order or invoice number along
							with a photo and we will replace at no charge for you! You can also send your photos and
							information to info@studiosve.com and Customer Service will be happy to assist you. Requests
							will be honored for up to 7 business days from receipt. After that we can’t honor the no
							charge replacement policy but are happy to replace your tile on a fee basis.</th>
